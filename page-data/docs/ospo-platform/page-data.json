We provide a platform of solutions with processes, tools, and support. We provide a team that combs through the organization, finding projects that may be ripe for open-sourcing. We also maintain and publicize our open source projects.</p>\n<p>This article will focus on the first of these three responsibilities. Our Open Source Platform aims to create a solid foundation upon which engineers can easily access, learn about, engage with, and contribute to open source.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#background\" aria-label=\"background permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Background</h2>\n<p>As engineers began engaging with our OSPO through Aux Eng, Dev Advocacy, and other outreach efforts, we quickly arrived at an inflection point in the scalability of our current resources, procedures, and tribal knowledge around the <strong>what</strong> and the <strong>how</strong> of doing open source. Within Wayfair, the OSPO team rolls up to a Development Platforms organization which strives to increase developer productivity, pave smooth onboarding paths, and reduce <a href=\"https://sre.google/workbook/eliminating-toil/\">toil</a> in day-to-day engineering processes. While this organization was originally built in service of engineers working primarily with closed-source software, we strongly believe that the same benefits of platform work apply to any company wishing to adopt open source at scale.</p>\n<p>By investing in an Open Source Platform, we can benefit both the OSPO and the engineering communities at Wayfair, and beyond, via the creation of meaningful developer productivity integrations, toil-reducing automation, and engaging content <em>(like this website, hopefully!)</em> which demystifies the world of open source.</p>\n<h2 id=\"platform\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#platform\" aria-label=\"platform permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Platform</h2>\n<p>Initially, our platform work involved surveying the current processes to get involved with open source, and measuring the toil of any manual steps. This approach helped temper the desire to ‚Äúautomate for the sake of automation,‚Äù instead only prioritizing enhancements that will meaningfully improve the current experience or lead to a significant reduction in toil.</p>\n<p>Beyond automated tools and workflows, we recognized an opportunity to provide clearer guidance on how to actually <em>engage</em> with open source. Given that some Wayfair engineers are completely new to open source, while others may be seasoned contributors or project maintainers, a one-size-fits-all approach was unlikely to scale well.</p>\n<p>Instead, we‚Äôve chosen to focus on curating materials for different audiences who are at varying stages of their open source journey, using <strong>wayfair.github.io</strong> as our homebase for the majority of this content. As we continue to build out the site, we‚Äôll aim to incorporate different learning styles by offering both pragmatic technical documentation and ‚Äúsnackable bites‚Äù expressed through interactive walkthroughs and other engaging media.</p>\n<h3 id=\"partnerships\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#partnerships\" aria-label=\"partnerships permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Partnerships</h3>\n<p>By partnering directly with Auxiliary Engineering, we‚Äôve tightened the feedback loop between the OSPO and the teams who engage with us by gaining direct insight into the real-world usability and intuitiveness of the tools, guides, and templates we provide.</p>\n<p>We also regularly solicit feedback from Wayfair engineers participating in open source projects with minimal guidance from the OSPO, to ensure the platform is not overly biased towards Auxiliary Engineering projects.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we leverage our Developer Advocacy arm for showcasing our publicly available platform offerings, in turn creating a mechanism for receiving diverse input from the broader open source community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"examples\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#examples\" aria-label=\"examples permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Examples</h2>\n<p>As a platform, we‚Äôre continuously looking for opportunities to refine and improve our current processes, workflows, and resources. Of course, as a relatively new and small team, there are upper bounds to the amount of platform work we can meaningfully prioritize at once, while balancing our obligations in various Auxiliary Engineering and Developer Advocacy engagements.</p>\n<p>The good news? We‚Äôve already made some cool stuff that we‚Äôre pretty proud of, and it‚Äôs begun paying real dividends in toil reduction and ease-of-onboarding to open source for the first (or second, or third) time. As an added bonus, by <a href=\"https://edume.com/blog/what-is-dogfooding\">dogfooding</a> our own OSPO platform, we can experience the pain and tedium of existing processes, collect data to quantify their relative bad-ness or urgency, and make iterative improvements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"templates\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#templates\" aria-label=\"templates permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Templates</h3>\n<p>In discussing some of the minimum criteria a typical open source project requires when starting out (eg. license, code of conduct, <code class=\"language-text\">README</code>), we realized that much of this project structure could be turned into a generic <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository\">template repository</a> that could apply to many common use cases. The culmination of those templating efforts has yielded our first project template: <a href=\"https://github.com/wayfair-incubator/oss-template\"><strong>oss-template</strong></a> üéâ</p>\n<p>Since its release, we‚Äôve leveraged this template numerous times for quickly scaffolding new projects, and best of all, it‚Äôs designed so that <em>anyone</em> in the broader community can use it to jumpstart their project. Beyond the obvious time-saving benefits, providing an open source template also allows our team to educate on and enforce basic standards for new and old projects alike.</p>\n<h3 id=\"forks\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#forks\" aria-label=\"forks permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Forks</h3>\n<p>As engineers began requesting <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo\">repository forks</a> to make upstream contributions to open source projects that Wayfair already uses internally, we quickly realized a bottleneck was forming. While creating a single fork isn‚Äôt particularly taxing, as an OSPO, we also needed to perform several manual checks: inspecting the repository to see which license was being used, comparing that against the list of licenses Wayfair currently allows, checking whether the requesting engineer‚Äôs GitHub account was already a member of our <a href=\"https://github.com/wayfair-contribs\"><strong>wayfair-contribs</strong></a> organization, and if not, sending them an invite.</p>\n<p>Rather than continue this manual slog, we decided to automate the workflow, and design the tooling in such a way that <em>other</em> OSPOs can potentially benefit from it. This work culminated in <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-forker\"><strong>Forker</strong></a>, a <a href=\"https://github.com/features/actions\">GitHub Action</a> powered by <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/typescript-action\">Typescript</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js\">Octokit.js</a>. Not only did developing Forker drastically reduce the number of manual steps required to complete forking requests, it also encouraged us to engage more directly with the <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace\">GitHub Marketplace</a>, as well as provide a practical example to other OSPOs interested in automating their open source workflows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"future\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#future\" aria-label=\"future permalink\" class=\"heading-anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Future</h2>\n<p>As anyone who‚Äôs familiar with platform work may know, we‚Äôre constantly striving to make both incremental, short-term improvements as well as strategic, longer-term changes that will jointly benefit the OSPO, Wayfair, and the open source community.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôve already planned several enhancements to our <a href=\"https://github.com/wayfair-incubator/oss-template\"><strong>oss-template</strong></a>, and are actively scoping the work required to create a fully self-serviceable pipeline for GitHub organizational requests by leveraging <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-forker\"><strong>Forker</strong></a> and other automated workflows.
