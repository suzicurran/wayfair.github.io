Welcome! You've stumbled upon the Wayfair Open Source Program Office documentation.

### What Is This Place?

Great question, stranger! Our docs here are intended to provide guidance and understanding of how Wayfair promotes and participates in Open Source software development. If you're an engineer, an engineering manager, or a leader in an engineering organization, this is a great place to learn more about topics like contributing and managing open source projects.

### Where Do I Start?

Use the navigation bar on the left (click "**Navigation**" on mobile) to find a relevant topic and start learning. We recommend you start by visiting our "**Get Involved**" link to walk through our Open Source Checklist.

**If you're _not_ a Wayfairian**, salutations! We're happy to provide this site to anyone who gets value out of it. Note that some of the content and opinons expressed cater best to the needs of Wayfair. Wayfair is not representative of every company or individual situation. Note that these guides may light your way without being a perfect fit for everyone.
